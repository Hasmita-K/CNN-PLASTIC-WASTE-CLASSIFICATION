# CNN-PLASTIC-WASTE-CLASSIFICATION
Using a CNN to classify plastic waste into different categories based on images.
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the automatic classification of plastic waste. This project aims to contribute to effective waste management and recycling efforts by automating the identification and sorting of plastic waste types, which is critical in achieving sustainable environmental practices.
