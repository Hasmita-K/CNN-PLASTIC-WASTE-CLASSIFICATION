# CNN-PLASTIC-WASTE-CLASSIFICATION
Using a CNN to classify plastic waste into different categories based on images.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the automatic classification of plastic waste. This project aims to contribute to effective waste management and recycling efforts by automating the identification and sorting of plastic waste types, which is critical in achieving sustainable environmental practices.
## Objectives
1. Use a labeled dataset of images representing various types of plastic waste.
2. Design and train a CNN model capable of accurately classifying plastic waste types based on visual features.
3. Evaluate the model's performance.
4. Optimize the model for deployment in real-world scenarios.
## Motivation and Importance of the Project
Plastic waste poses a significant environmental challenge, and proper sorting is essential to ensure efficient recycling. Manual classification is labor-intensive, error-prone, and inefficient. Leveraging CNNs for image-based plastic waste classification can enhance the speed and accuracy of the sorting process, thus aiding recycling industries and promoting a greener planet.
## Dataset
Link to access dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data/data
The dataset consists of 25,077 images of recyclable and organic waste.
## Methodology
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
-Gather a dataset of plastic waste images from open sources or create a custom dataset.
-Perform preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation, to improve model generalization.
2. Model Design:
-Implement a CNN architecture using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
-Experiment with popular architectures like VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet, or design a custom CNN tailored to the dataset.
3. Training and Evaluation:
-Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
-Train the CNN model using appropriate optimization techniques.
-Evaluate the model on test data and fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
## Weekly Updates
Week 1 (20th January 2025 - 24th January 2025): Installation of libraries, importing data, and basic setup.
## Future Scope
1. Extend the project to classify other waste categories such as glass, metal, and paper.
2. Integrate the model with IoT devices for real-time waste classification.
3. Collaborate with industries and organizations to deploy the solution on a larger scale.
